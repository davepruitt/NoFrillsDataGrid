# NoFrillsDataGrid
This is a no-frills data grid control for Xamarin Forms. It uses SkiaSharp as the means to create and draw the data grid itself.

This is still in its early stages, and I have only made a Xamarin Forms version so far. However, since it uses SkiaSharp, porting it to Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS should be extremely simple.

Please see the code for usage details.
